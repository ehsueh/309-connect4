> well... first, figure out what all that code is doing.

============= PERFORMANCE/VISUAL STUFF =============
> when two users, user1 and user2, start a game, they should see the board and maybe the chat area.
> board starts out as a blue rectangle, 7 x 6 white holes (7 width, 6 height)

> on user1's (the inviter) side, display: "Please make a move." since inviter starts first
> on user2's side, display: "Please wait for other player to make a move."
> This display alternates. So after user1 makes a move, he/she has to wait for user2 to make a move.
> colours: user1 = red, user2 = yellow

> to make a move, user selects column with left and right keyboard keys. Space will drop the piece.
> display a green square outlining the column we're on?
> default could be 0th column

> when user makes a move, a circle of that user's colour will drop down into the column
> ... so need to keep track of where the "bottom" of that column is

> after every move, check various things:
	> if that completes a row of 4 or more
		> alert users of their state
		> change match state to U1WIN or U2WIN.
		> alert redirects users to arcade page, ending the game.
	> else if the number of pieces in the board = 6*7 = 42, there are no more moves
		> change match state to TIE
		> alert users of what happened, redirecting to arcade page, ending the game
	> else (not a winning move)
		> continue


============= ALGORITHMS STUFF ==============
> checking current board for row of 4
> checking current board for number of pieces
	> if == 42, gg.
